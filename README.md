# Why I made this
Randall Munroe's comic, *xkcd*,  has been my favorite comic for a long time. Creating a CLI for it was fun and helpful for myself. I hope that the *xkcd* community also enjoys this creation. I do plan to add some other features.

# Installation

For the time being, the easiest way to install this is either by cloning it with `git` or downloading directly from GitHub.

Once the program is on your system, install the required packages using the following command:
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using Windows remove the 3 from the command.

# Usage
The two current ways to get a comic is by either using the comic number or its title. The title method is still a work in progress. You can also just get information about the specified comic, if that is what you are looking for.
